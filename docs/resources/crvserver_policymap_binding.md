# Resource: crvserver_policymap_binding

The crvserver_policymap_binding resource is used to create CR vserver Policymap Binding.


## Example usage

```hcl
resource "citrixadc_crvserver" "crvserver" {
  name        = "my_vserver"
  servicetype = "HTTP"
  ipv46       = "10.102.80.55"
  port        = 8090
  cachetype   = "REVERSE"
}
resource "citrixadc_policymap" "tf_policymap" {
  mappolicyname = "ia_mappol123"
  sd            = "amazon.com"
  td            = "apple.com"
}
resource "citrixadc_lbvserver" "foo_lbvserver" {
  name        = "test_lbvserver"
  servicetype = "HTTP"
  ipv46       = "192.122.3.31"
  port        = 8000
  comment     = "hello"
}
resource "citrixadc_service" "tf_service" {
  lbvserver   = citrixadc_lbvserver.foo_lbvserver.name
  name        = "tf_service"
  port        = 8081
  ip          = "10.33.4.5"
  servicetype = "HTTP"
  cachetype   = "TRANSPARENT"
}
resource "citrixadc_crvserver_policymap_binding" "crvserver_policymap_binding" {
  name          = citrixadc_crvserver.crvserver.name
  policyname    = citrixadc_policymap.tf_policymap.mappolicyname
  targetvserver = citrixadc_lbvserver.foo_lbvserver.name
  depends_on = [
    citrixadc_service.tf_service
  ]
}

```


## Argument Reference

* `name` - (Required) Name of the cache redirection virtual server to which to bind the cache redirection policy.
* `bindpoint` - (Optional) For a rewrite policy, the bind point to which to bind the policy. Note: This parameter applies only to rewrite policies, because content switching policies are evaluated only at request time.
* `gotopriorityexpression` - (Optional) Expression or other value specifying the next policy to be evaluated if the current policy evaluates to TRUE.  Specify one of the following values: * NEXT - Evaluate the policy with the next higher priority number. * END - End policy evaluation. * USE_INVOCATION_RESULT - Applicable if this policy invokes another policy label. If the final goto in the invoked policy label has a value of END, the evaluation stops. If the final goto is anything other than END, the current policy label performs a NEXT. * An expression that evaluates to a number. If you specify an expression, the number to which it evaluates determines the next policy to evaluate, as follows: * If the expression evaluates to a higher numbered priority, the policy with that priority is evaluated next. * If the expression evaluates to the priority of the current policy, the policy with the next higher numbered priority is evaluated next. * If the expression evaluates to a priority number that is numerically higher than the highest numbered priority, policy evaluation ends. An UNDEF event is triggered if: * The expression is invalid. * The expression evaluates to a priority number that is numerically lower than the current policy's priority. * The expression evaluates to a priority number that is between the current policy's priority number (say, 30) and the highest priority number (say, 100), b ut does not match any configured priority number (for example, the expression evaluates to the number 85). This example assumes that the priority number incr ements by 10 for every successive policy, and therefore a priority number of 85 does not exist in the policy label.
* `invoke` - (Optional) Invoke a policy label if this policy's rule evaluates to TRUE (valid only for default-syntax policies such as application firewall, transform, integrated cache, rewrite, responder, and content switching).
* `labelname` - (Optional) Name of the label to be invoked.
* `labeltype` - (Optional) Type of label to be invoked.
* `policyname` - (Optional) Policies bound to this vserver.
* `priority` - (Optional) An unsigned integer that determines the priority of the policy relative to other policies bound to this cache redirection virtual server. The lower the value, higher the priority. Note: This option is available only when binding content switching, filtering, and compression policies to a cache redirection virtual server.
* `targetvserver` - (Optional) The CSW target server names.


## Attribute Reference

In addition to the arguments, the following attributes are available:

* `id` - The id of the crvserver_policymap_binding. It has the same value as the `name` attribute.


## Import

A crvserver_policymap_binding can be imported using its name, e.g.

```shell
terraform import citrixadc_crvserver_policymap_binding.crvserver_policymap_binding my_vserver,ia_mappol123
```
