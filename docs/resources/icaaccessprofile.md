# Resource: icaaccessprofile

The icaaccessprofile resource is used to create icaaccessprofile.


## Example usage

```hcl
resource "citrixadc_icaaccessprofile" "tf_icaaccessprofile" {
  name                   = "my_ica_accessprofile"
  connectclientlptports  = "DEFAULT"
  localremotedatasharing = "DEFAULT"
}

```


## Argument Reference

* `name` - (Required) Name for the ICA accessprofile. Must begin with a letter, number, or the underscore character (_), and must contain only letters, numbers, and the hyphen (-), period (.) pound (#), space ( ), at (@), equals (=), colon (:), and underscore characters. Cannot be changed after the ICA accessprofile is added. The following requirement applies only to the Citrix ADC CLI: If the name includes one or more spaces, enclose the name in double or single quotation marks (for example, "my ica accessprofile" or 'my ica accessprofile'). Each of the features can be configured as DEFAULT/DISABLED. Here, DISABLED means that the policy settings on the backend XenApp/XenDesktop server are overridden and the Citrix ADC makes the decision to deny access. Whereas DEFAULT means that the Citrix ADC allows the request to reach the XenApp/XenDesktop that takes the decision to allow/deny access based on the policy configured on it. For example, if ClientAudioRedirection is enabled on the backend XenApp/XenDesktop server, and the configured profile has ClientAudioRedirection as DISABLED, the Citrix ADC makes the decision to deny the request irrespective of the configuration on the backend. If the configured profile has ClientAudioRedirection as DEFAULT, then the Citrix ADC forwards the requests to the backend XenApp/XenDesktop server.It then makes the decision to allow/deny access based on the policy configured on it. Minimum length =  1
